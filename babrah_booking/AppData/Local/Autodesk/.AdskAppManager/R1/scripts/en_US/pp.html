<hr/><a name="_Autodesk_and_you_1" id="_Autodesk_and_you_1"></a><h2>Autodesk and you</h2>
We’re focused on building tools and communities for people who imagine, design and create great things.  You might be a professional, a student, or a design enthusiast working on something in your personal time.  You might be engaging with us through a mobile device, desktop computer, or your web browser.  No matter who you are or what you do, we appreciate that we’ve earned your time and attention.  We also appreciate that different people have different privacy concerns.   <a id="_How_to_use_2"></a><h2>How to use this privacy statement</h2>
<p>This privacy statement tells you about  our online and offline privacy practices.<br />
Our primary goal is to help you  understand what we do (and don&rsquo;t do) when it comes to your personal  information, so we&rsquo;ve done our best to be clear.  We&rsquo;ve provided different ways for you to look  up topics of interest to you.  As a  result, we may repeat important points.  <br />
In this statement we refer to our  products, online services and web services, and apps (online, mobile and  desktop) as &ldquo;applications.&rdquo;  <a name="_What_this_privacy" id="_What_this_privacy"></a>Sometimes we may refer to something specific like  a &ldquo;website,&rdquo; &ldquo;mobile application&rdquo; or &ldquo;online service&rdquo; for clarity.</p><a id="_What_this_privacy_2"></a><h2>What this privacy statement covers (and what it doesn’t)</h2>
<h3>Websites and applications that link to this  privacy statement are covered </h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      
      This privacy statement tells you about our privacy practices for  our websites and applications that include a link or reference to this  statement.  It also tells you about our  marketing and advertising practices, and applies to our offline practices.   
     
    </p>
  </blockquote>
<h3>Sometimes there&rsquo;s more information in context,  when you need it</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Some of our websites and applications may display supplemental  privacy or data collection notices that we share so you can make informed  choices about what you want to do at the time you review the notices.  For example, you may see a notice explaining  a data collection program in an application, and your choices for  participating. </p>
  </blockquote>
<h3>Websites and applications that <u>do not</u> link  to this privacy statement are covered by other privacy policies or statements</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes, websites and applications owned by Autodesk may have  their own privacy statements or policies.   For example, we may buy another company to expand our business, and need  some time to fully integrate the company&rsquo;s privacy practices with the ones we  explain here.</p>
  </blockquote>
<h3>Third parties</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Third parties are responsible for their own privacy  practices.  These include social media  platforms or other company websites that we link to from our websites and  applications.  Be sure to read the  privacy policies, supplemental notices, and settings of all websites or  platforms that you visit so you can understand their privacy practices and your  options.</p>
  </blockquote>
<h3>Terms of use, terms of service and software  license agreements cover issues like content</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Websites and applications are subject to terms such as our website <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=786919">terms of use</a>, application <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=17752585">terms of service</a>, and <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=10235425">software license agreements</a>.   These terms can help answer questions you may have about the  confidentiality and security of designs and other content you create, and the  effect when you share and post content.</p>

<h3><a name="_Do_not_track_" id="_Do_not_track_"></a>&ldquo;Do not track&rdquo; and similar mechanisms</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some web browsers may transmit  &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to websites with which the browser  communicates.  Because of differences in  how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear  whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even  aware of them. <br />
    Participants in the leading Internet  standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process  of determining what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such  signals. Autodesk currently does not take action in response to these signals.  If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how  to respond to these signals. <br />

<a id="_Information_we_collect_1"></a><h3>Information we collect from children, how we use it, and how and when we  communicate with parents</h3>
<p>Here are ways in which we collect personal information from  children, as well as how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek  parental consent.  In the event we  discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent  with COPPA&rsquo;s requirements, we will promptly either delete the information or seek  the parent&rsquo;s consent for that collection.</p>
<p>  Consistent with what COPPA requires, where we have an age  screen in place and we determine the user is age 12 or under, we will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ask for a parent or guardian email address  before we collect personal information from the child</li>
  <li>offer an age-appropriate experience for the  child, consistent with COPPA requirements, or</li>
  <li>not allow access to those sections or features  the site or application directed to a general interest audience (those age 13  and over).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Registration" id="_Registration"></a>Registration</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Where an application is age  appropriate, children can register with our website or application to (among  other things): </p>
  <ul>
    <li>view, interact with and download content </li>
    <li>take tutorials, create, edit, and import content </li>
    <li>like or follow other creators and their content</li>
    <li>comment on others&rsquo; content </li>
    <li>participate in contests </li>
    <li>view in application notifications</li>
    <li>create &ldquo;wishlists&rdquo; of items they are interested  in (like robotics kits)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During the registration process,  we may ask the child to provide certain personal information for security  purposes and so we can send notices to parents, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a parent or guardian&rsquo;s email address</li>
    <li>the child&rsquo;s first name</li>
    <li>the child&rsquo;s member or account username, and  password</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We also may ask for birth dates  from children to validate their ages. </p>
  <p>  A child&rsquo;s username will be either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a random combination of words suggested by our  systems, or</li>
    <li>a child can select their own username, and we  advise children not to provide any personal information in their usernames</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If a child chooses not to  share their personal  information with us, this limits their access to  account creation and certain features.  </p>
  <p>  We will not require a child to  provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate  in an online activity.</p>
  <p>  Also, we will keep the information  consistent with our <a href="#_Data_retention">retention practices</a> – that  is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to honor your choices</li>
    <li>to fulfill the purposes described in this  privacy statement; for example:
      <ul>
        <li>only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill  the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the  activity</li>
        <li>to help ensure the security of our users and our  services</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>as required or permitted by applicable laws and  regulations</li>
  </ul>

<h3><a name="_Content_Generated_by" id="_Content_Generated_by"></a><a name="_Verifiable_parental_consent" id="_Verifiable_parental_consent"></a>Verifiable parental consent</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Depending on the website or  application, we may seek different types of parental consent.  In each case, when we ask for consent we will  provide notice about the specific activities available to a child through the  website or application.</p>
  <p><strong>High level parental consent</strong></p>
  <p>    We seek &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; consent from a  parent as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>by asking for a credit card or other payment  method for verification (with a nominal charge involved), or</li>
    <li>by requiring a signed consent form by mail or  email attachment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After providing high-level consent,  we may offer parents the opportunity to use a pin or password in future  communications as a way to confirm the parent&rsquo;s identity.</p>
  <p><strong>Teacher consent in lieu of a parent</strong></p>
  <p>    For school-based activities, COPPA  allows teachers and school administrators to act in the place of parents to  provide consent for the collection of personal information from children.  Schools should always notify parents about these activities. </p>
  <p>    In some cases, in order that an  account is not closed and so that a child can continue to use a website or  application outside of the school context, we may ask schools to obtain consent  directly from a parent instead of and/or in addition to providing consent in  the place of a parent.</p>
  <p> For more information on parental  rights with respect to a child&rsquo;s educational record under the U.S. Family  Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), please see the <a href="_Education_and_FERPA_1">FERPA section</a> below.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="_Specific_activities" id="_Specific_activities"></a>Specific  activities</h3>

  <p><strong>Content Generated by a Child</strong></p>
  <p>  Our websites and applications include  activities that allow children to create or manipulate content and save  it.  Some of these activities do not  require children to provide any personal information and therefore may not  result in notice to the parent or require parental consent. </p>
  <p>    If an activity potentially allows a  child to insert personal information in their created content, we will seek  verifiable parental consent. </p>
  <p>    Examples of child created content  that may include personal information are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>open-text fields</li>
    <li>drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information</li>
    <li>uploaded content that includes text, models or  images </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If, in addition to collecting  content that includes personal information, we plan to post the content  publicly or share it with a third party for the third party&rsquo;s own use, we will  obtain &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; parental consent.  An  example of another party&rsquo;s use of the information would be an online magazine  using an application programming interface (API) to access and republish (as  part of a &ldquo;feed&rdquo; or online display) one or more designs a child has posted  publically.  This is similar to &ldquo;Twitter  feeds&rdquo; or other social media feeds you might see in an online newspaper.</p>
  <p><strong>Forums and comments</strong></p>
  <p>    Certain activities allow users to  communicate directly with other users by means user forums or comments sections.  We first seek high level parental consent  before allowing a child access to such features.</p>
  <p>    We strongly encourage children who  use these interactive features on our websites and in our applications never to  provide personal information about themselves or any third party, and not to  attempt to circumvent any moderation features. </p>
  <p>    We also recommend that parents  carefully supervise their children when the children participate in online  activities.</p>
  <p><strong>Contests </strong></p>
  <p>    For contests, we typically require  only the information necessary for a child to participate, such as user name and  parent email address (to notify the parent where required by law). We only  contact the parent for more personalized information for prize-fulfillment  purposes if the child wins the contest.</p>
  <p><strong>Email Contact with a Child</strong></p>
<p>    In some of our applications, we may  collect online contact information, such as an email address, in order to  communicate with a child who makes a specific request.  For example, a child may email us to ask for  help in understanding how to use a design tool if she or he is having trouble  with it, or the child may want to sign up for a monthly newsletter.  Here is how we would handle communication  requests.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>One time  communication</strong>
      <blockquote>
        <p>After we respond to the child&rsquo;s question or request, we will delete this  information immediately after responding to the question or request.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
</ul>
    
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Communicating  more than once</strong>
  
      <blockquote>
        <p>Where there is an activity or service where we need to communicate with a  child more than once:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If we collect the child&rsquo;s contact information  for ongoing communications (like for a newsletter), we will also require a  parent&rsquo;s email address (if we have not already obtained verifiable parental  consent) so we can notify the parent about the collection and use, and to  provide the parent with an opportunity to prevent further contact with the  child.
            <ul>
              <li>If a child is engaged in more than one ongoing  communication, the parent may need to opt-out of each communication separately.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      </li>

  <p><strong>Persistent Identifiers</strong></p>
  <p>  When children interact with us,  certain information may be collected automatically, both to make our sites and  applications more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes  related to our business.  <br />
    Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the type of computer operating system</li>
    <li>the child&rsquo;s IP address or mobile device  identifier</li>
    <li>the web browser used</li>

<a id="_When_information_collected"></a><h3>When information collected from children is available to third parties</h3>
In addition to those cases where a child&rsquo;s personal  information is posted publicly (after receiving high-level parental consent),  we also may share or disclose personal information collected from children in a  limited number of instances, including the following:
<ul>
  <li>we may share information with our service  providers if necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or  technology support function for us</li>
  <li>we may disclose personal information if  permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a  subpoena</li>
  <li>to the extent permitted by applicable law, we  also may disclose personal information collected from children:
  <ul>
    <li>in response to a law enforcement or public  agency&rsquo;s (including schools or children services) request</li>
    <li>if we believe disclosure may prevent the  instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or  protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications</li>
    <li>to protect the security or integrity of our  sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our  service providers</li>
    <li>to enable us to take precautions against  liability</li>

<a id="_Education_and_FERPA_1"></a><a name="_Certification" id="_Certification"></a><a name="_Changes_to_this" id="_Changes_to_this"></a><h2>Education and FERPA</h2>
<p>If you are using our applications  through a school program, your personal information may be subject to the  Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  We have included information here that is  most relevant to our products and services when they are used by schools that  are subject to FERPA.  You can look at  the <a href="http://www.ed.gov" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Education website</a> for more information.  </p>
<p>FERPA is a United States law that provides certain rights with  respect to student education records and personal information associated with  those records.  Parents exercise these  rights on behalf of their children under 18.   These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of  18 or attends a school beyond the high school (12th grade) level,  known as &quot;eligible students.&quot;</p>
<p>FERPA gives parents and eligible students certain rights (subject  to limitations), including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the right to inspect and review the  student's education records maintained by the school</li>
  <li>the right to request that a school  correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule, schools subject to FERPA must have written  permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any  information from a student's education record.   However, under certain circumstances schools are allowed to disclose  records without consent, including under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to school officials with legitimate  educational interest
  <ul>
    <li>this can include vendors providing  services to schools</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>to other schools to which a student is  transferring</li>
  <li>directory information (subject to an  opt-out)</li>
  <li>to appropriate officials in cases of  health and safety emergencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools are required to notify parents and eligible students  annually of their rights under FERPA.  Each  school can choose how to provide notification (for example, sending a special  letter or including the information in a student handbook).</p>
<p>We help schools comply with their obligations under FERPA in various  ways, depending on the application being used.   This can include obtaining consent directly from a parent or eligible  student and providing them with direct access to relevant information within  our applications, or providing schools with the ability to manage parent or  eligible student requests. </p>
